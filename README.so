# Text emotion prediction ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜ƒ

In my recent project aimed at predicting text emotion with labels encompassing `anger`, `fear`, and `joy`, I explored various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. Among the methodologies tested, including SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, and Universal Sentence Encoder, CatBoost emerged as the top performer, achieving an impressive accuracy score of **0.936**. This outcome underscores the effectiveness of CatBoost in discerning nuanced emotional cues within text data, highlighting its robustness and suitability for emotion prediction tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.

To execute the streamlit application -
```
python -m streamlit run emotion_prediction.py
```
